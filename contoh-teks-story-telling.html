                        <p>The Donkey Who Would Sing </p><br /><p>A wild donkey once lived in the woods. He had no friends and lived all alone. </p><br /><p>One day a jackal passing by saw the donkey. He went up to the donkey and said, “What is the matter? Why do you look so sad my dear fellow?" </p><br /><p>The donkey turned to the jackal and said, “I have no friends and am very lonely." </p><br /><p>“Well, don't worry. I will be your friend from today," the jackal comforted him. </p><br /><p>From that day, the donkey and jackal became very good friends. They were always seen together. </p><br /><p>One moonlit evening, the jackal and the donkey were strolling through the woods. It was a cool and pleasant evening. As they walked on, they came to the outskirts of a village bordering the woods. There in front of them was a grove of fruit trees. </p><br /><p>“Ah. Look! How wonderful and delicious the fruits look," said the donkey. “Let’s eat some of them." </p><br /><p>“Okay," said the jackal. “But let’s do it very quietly." </p><br /><p>They entered the grove and silently started to eat the fruits. After eating enough, they lay under a tree happy and content. “That was delicious, but there is something missing tonight," said the donkey. </p><br /><p>“What is that?" asked the jackal. “Why, music of course," answered the donkey, looking a little surprised. </p><br /><p>The jackal asked, “Where are we going to get music from?" The donkey said. “Don’t you know that I am an accomplished singer?" </p><br /><p>The jackal was alarmed. "Remember, we are in an orchard. If the farmer hears us, we will be in trouble. If you want to sing let us go away from here," he advised the donkey. </p><br /><p>"You think I can't sing, don't you?" asked the donkey in a hurt voice. </p><br /><p>“Wait till you hear me." </p><br /><p>The jackal realised that the donkey was not willing to take his good advice. He moved away and hid himself behind a clump of trees. The donkey threw back his head and started his song. “He …haw, hee-haw," he brayed aloud. </p><br /><p>The farmers hearing the loud braying came rushing with sticks and gave the foolish donkey a severe beating that left the donkey feeling sore all over. </p><br /><p>After the farmers had left, the jackal went over to his friend. He said. “Is this the prize you won for your singing?" </p><br /><p>“They don’t appreciate good music," replied a hurt and ashamed donkey. </p><br /><p>The jackal replied. “This is what happens when you don’t listen to the advice given by a good friend. I hope you have learnt a lesson."</p><br /><br /><br />

                        The Boy Who Cried Wolf<br /><br />A shepherd-boy, who watched a group of sheep near a village, shocked out the villagers three or four times by screaming out, “Wolf! Wolf!” and when his neighbors were there to help him,he laughed at them for their pains.<br /><br />However the Wolf, truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really in danger, cried in an agony of terror: “Pray, please come and help me; the Wolf is approaching to kill the sheep”; but no one paid any attention to his cries, nor rendered any help. The Wolf, having no cause of scary, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole sheep in group.<br /><br /> There is no believing  liars, even when they speak the truth.<br />Artinya<br /><br />Anak Laki – Laki Yang Berteriak Serigala<br /><br />Seorang anak gembala, yang melihat sekelompok domba di dekat sebuah desa, mengejutkanorang – orang di desadengan berteriak tiga atau empat kali, “Serigala! Serigala!” dan ketika tetangganya berada datang ke  sana untuk membantunya, dia menertawai  mereka yang dengan susah payah datang.<br /><br />Akan tetapi, serigala benar-benar datang pada akhirnya. Anakg embala itu sekarang benar-benar dalam bahaya, menangis dalam penderitaankarena  terancam: ” Ya Tuhan,  datanglah dan bantu saya; Serigal semakin mendekat untuk  membunuh domba”; tapi tidak ada perhatian apapun atau bantuan yang datang untuk tangisannya; Serigala kemudian tanpa takut menyerang  seluruh domba milik pemuda yang ada dalam kelompok itu.<br /><br /><br />The Miser<br /><br />A miser sold all things that he had to buy a lump made of gold, which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily. One of his workmen noted his frequent visits to the spot and determined to watch his movements. He soon uncovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold hidden by a miser, and stole it. On his next visit, the Miser, found nothing inside the hole and started to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, looking at him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, “Pray, do not grieve so; but go and put a stone in the hole, and imagine that the gold is still lying there. It will do to you quite the same act; for once the gold was there, you left it nothing, as you did not make the slightest use of it.”<br /><br />Si Pelit<br /><br />Seorang yang kikir menjual seluruh benda yang ia miliki untuk membeli seongkah emas, yang dia timbun di sebuah lubang bawah  tanah di sisi dinding tua dan selalu dia lihat setiap hari. Salah satu pekerja nya kemudian bertanya – tanya tentang kebiasaan si Pelit yang sering berkunjung ke tempat itu dan bertekad untuk mengawasi gerak – geriknya. Tak lama setelah itu dia menemukan rahasia harta karun yang disimpan si Pelit, dan menggali hingga sampai ke bongkahan emas yang disembunyikan oleh si Pelit, dan mencurinya. Pada kunjungan berikutnya, si Pelit, tidak menemukan apa-apa di dalam lubang dan mulai menangis dan meratap dengan keras. Seorang tetangga, kemudian menatapnya dan mencoba mengatasi kesedihannya dan mempelajari penyebabnya, kemudian dia berkata, “Berdoalah, jangan bersedih begitu; Tapi pergi dan letakkan batu di dalam lubang, dan membayangkan bahwa emasmu masih ada di sana. Batu ini akan melakukan ke pada anda tindakan yang sama, karena pada waktu emas ada di sana, anda meninggalkannya begitu saja, karena anda tidak memanfaatkannya barang sedikitpun”.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>judul: RADEN AJENG KARTINI</p><p></p><p>Assalamu’alakum Wr. Wb.</p><p>Good morning everyone….</p><p>Here, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Kanaya Novivian Tabitha Angel. You can call me Naya. I’m 16 years old. I’m from SMK Negeri 1 Seyegan.</p><p></p><p>Today I'am going to deliver about the story of Raden Ajeng Kartini</p><p></p><p>Raden Ajeng Kartini she is also commonly known as R.A Kartini. She is known as one of the national hero determined to fight for the emancipation of women.</p><p></p><p>So ladies and gentleman ....</p><p>Here is the story of R.A. Kartini</p><p>          Once upon a time, in the city of Jepara, there was born a beautiful baby from javanese royal family. Her name is Kartini who has a long name Raden Adjeng Kartini , she is the daughter of a duke who later became regent of Jepara, Raden Mas Adipati Ario Sosroningrat. The mother of Kartini is Ngasirah, the first wife of Sosroningrat who worked as a teacher in a school at Telukawur, Jepara.</p><p></p><p>Kartini's Father: “My wife, look at our child, she is so beautiful, she is like you."</p><p>Kartini's Mother: "Yes she is so charming, may God makes her loyal to their family and useful for a lot of people.”</p><p>Kartini's Father: "Definitely my wife, she would be useful for many people"</p><p></p><p>          Little Kartini grew into a cheerful girl, she played with other like she grew up in royal family. When he was 12 years old, she was prohibited from continuing his studies in Europese Lagere School (ELS) where she also learned Dutch. The prohibition to pursue the ideals of her schooling comes from her closest person, her father, because at the time she was a girl who was 12 years old and she must undergo seclusion/ “dipingit”.</p><p></p><p>Kartini: “May I apologize my father for disturbing you, I want to ask something for you.”</p><p>Kartini's Father: "it's okay my dear, what do you want to ask?.”</p><p>Kartini: “Sorry my father, would you tell me why you won’ let me go to school.”</p><p>Kartini's Father: “My Dear, you are now 12 years old, and it's about time you do seclusion, this is already customary,    you must follow the rule.”</p><p>Kartini: “I’m sorry father, but I still want to go to school, I would have missed them, my teachers, I still want to learn, and I still want to play with my sisters, Roekmini and Kardinah.”</p><p>Kartini's Father: “You have to follow the rule! Do you dare to oppose our custom!”</p><p></p><p>          Because there was no power on her  against the wishes of his father, young Kartini resorted to do the seclusion. However, young kartini still wanted to seek a knowledge, explore their curiosity, and still want to be useful for many people.</p><p></p><p>          During the seclusion she wrote letters to her dutch friends to gain the knowledge of Europe concerning rights as human beings especially women.</p><p></p><p>Kartini: “I have to fix my life, even though I do not currently have the right to argue, at least other women do not suffer like me. Yes and I should start it with writing.”</p><p>Kartini: “it seems to be interesting when I started to write a letter to my friend Rosa Abendanon to share her knowledge to me.”</p><p></p><p>          Since that time the relationship between Rosa and kartini worked continuously , Rosa Abendanon also often sent books and newspapers from Europe to young Kartini so her thinking becomes more advanced. In the European newspaper told that women have the same position to achieve their rights while in Indonesia, women are at a very low social stratum.</p><p></p><p>Kartini: “Rosa you are are a such best friend, well, it seems not quite enough if I just learn from Rosa, I had to share this with other women, they should have the this.”</p><p></p><p>          After doing the seclusion, she marriage with a regent of Rembang named Duke Ario Singgih Djojo Adhiningrat over the choice of her parents. At the time Kartini status as the second wife of the regent of Rembang. However her husband strongly support his ideals and even allow Kartini builtd a women school.</p><p></p><p>Kartini: “My husband, sorry if I’m disturbing you, if I may ask as the duke's wife, do you allow me to built a school for a woman.”</p><p>Duke Ario Singgih Djojo Adhiningrat: “Kartini, if that is your wish, I will.”</p><p>Kartini: “Thank you my Duke.”</p><p></p><p>          During her marriage, Kartini blessed with one son named Soesalit Djojoadhiningrat. Kartini passed away on her 25 years old, her last four days after giving birth.</p><p></p><p>          The Kartini’s struggle did not stop even after his death. The struggle continued by his friend Rosa Abendanon who posted the both letters into a book. The book was entitled “Door Duisternis tot Licht” which means "From the Darkness Into the Light".</p><p></p><p>          In 1964, President Ir. Soekarno declarated Kartini birth date, on 21 April as “Kartini’s Day” an Indonesian national day.</p><p></p><p>          Afterwards, Kartini recognized not only a hero determined to fight emancipation of women, but also a nationalist figure with new ideas who struggled for independence.</p><p></p><p>          As a woman, Kartini is alredy known as a famous women hero and an important for Indonesia. Let us be the next Kartini!.</p><p></p><p>Okay, I think that’s all, thanks for your attention.</p><p></p><p>Wassalamu’alaikum Wr.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Di kalangan aktivis, khususnya aktivis Muhammadiyah, nama Djazman al-Kindi begitu sangat popular. Hal ini dikarenakan, Djazman adalah cendekiawan muslim dan aktivis Muhammadiyah yang sangat ideologis yang pikiran-pikirannya sangat revolusioner. Ia tidak hanya kritis terhadap persoalan pendidikan, kondisi umat Islam, persoalan bangsa dan juga situasi global saat itu, tapi juga, Ia menghembuskan pikiran-pikiran kritikalnya terhadap kondisi dan masa depan Muhammadiyah. Djazman adalah merupakan tokoh kunci lahirnya organisasi Ikatan Mahasiswa Muhammadiyah (IMM) pada 14 Maret 1964.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Nama lengkap al-Kindi adalah Abu Yusuf Ya`qub ibn Ishaq ibn Shabbah ibn Imran ibn Isma`il ibn Muhammad ibn al-Asy’ath ibn Qais al-Kindi. Tahun kelahiran dan kematian al-Kindi tidak diketahui secara jelas. Yang dapat dipastikan tentang hal ini adalah bahwa ia hidup pada masa kekhalifahan al-Amin (809-813), al-Ma’mun (813-833), al-Mu’tasim (833-842), al-Wathiq (842-847), dan al-Mutawakkil (847-861).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Al-Kindi hidup pada masa penerjemahan besar-besaan karya-karya Yunani ke dalam bahasa Arab. Dan memang, sejak didirikannya Bayt al-Hikmah oleh al-Ma’mun, al-Kindi sendiri turut aktif dalam kegiatan penerjemahan ini. Di samping menerjemah, al-Kindi juga memperbaiki terjemahan-terjemahan sebelumnya.

                        The first President of the Republic of Indonesia, Soekarno, who was usually called Bung Karno, was born in Blitar, East Java, June 6, 1901 and died in Jakarta, June 21, 1970. His father was named Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo and his mother Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai. During his life, he had three wives and was blessed with eight children. From Fatmawati's wife, Guntur, Megawati, Rachmawati, Sukmawati and Guruh have children. From his wife Hartini has Taufan and Bayu, while from the wife of Ratna Sari Dewi, a Japanese descendant whose real name is Naoko Nemoto has Kartika's child ...<br /><br />Soekarno's childhood was only a few years living with his parents in Blitar. During elementary school until graduation, he lived in Surabaya, boarding house in the house of Haji Oemar Said Tokroaminoto, veteran politician founder of Syarikat Islam. Then go to school at HBS (Hoogere Burger School). While studying at HBS, Soekarno had galvanized his nationalistic spirit. After graduating from HBS in 1920, he moved to Bandung and continued to THS (Technische Hoogeschool or High Engineering School which is now an ITB). He won the title "Ir" on May 25, 1926.<br /><br />Later, he formulated the Marhaenism teaching and founded PNI (Indonesian National Party) on July 4, 1927, with the aim of an Independent Indonesia. As a result, the Dutch included him in Sukamiskin prison, Bandung on December 29, 1929. Eight months later he was tried. In his defense entitled Indonesia Menggugat, he showed the apostasy of the Dutch, a nation that claimed to be more advanced.<br /><br />His defense made the Dutch even more angry. So that in July 1930, PNI was dissolved. After being released in 1931, Soekarno joined Partindo and at the same time led him. As a result, he was arrested again by the Dutch and exiled to Ende, Flores, in 1933. Four years later he was transferred to Bengkulu.<br /><br />After a long struggle, Bung Karno and Bung Hatta proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Indonesia on August 17, 1945.

Mohammad Hatta proclaimed Indonesian independence. In the PPKI session, August 18, 1945, Ir. Bloekarno was elected by acclamation as the first President of the Republic of Indonesia.<br /><br />Previously, he also succeeded in formulating the Pancasila which later became the basis (ideology) of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia. He tried to unite the archipelago. Even Soekarno tried to gather nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America with the Asian-African Conference in Bandung in 1955 which later developed into a Non-Aligned Movement.<br /><br />The G30-S / PKI rebellion gave birth to a great political crisis which caused the MPR's rejection of its responsibility. Instead the MPR appointed Suharto as Acting President. His health continued to deteriorate, which on Sunday, June 21, 1970 he died at the RSPAD. He was buried in Wisma Yaso, Jakarta and buried in Blitar, East Java near the tomb of his mother, Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai.

“ THE
BEEF AND THE CAT ”

I do hope you’ll be happy after listening to my story, because
getting the audience or listeners happy is the purpose of this story, isn’t it
?                                                  

Are you ready ?                                                                                                               

Ok listen to me carefully in order to be able to
catch the sound, expression, and others so you can enjoy this story.

Long
time ago in Aksehir, there lived a happy couple. They were Nasrudin Hoja and
his beloved wife. Nasrudin Hoja was a very funny, smart and famous in that
country, so everyone knew him very much. He liked going round his village. One
day, after he was going round, he brought 2 kilos of beef and when he came in
front of the door of his house, he knocked it.

Thok Thok Thok ! Honey I’m comming. Then his wife opened the door for him.

Kreeet,
the sound of the door. Oh dear what is in your hand?

2 kilos of beef, Nasrudin answered.

Please use this to make kabob tonight. We will have a big meal
this night, he said.

Yes, dear I will make nice kabob for you. Said
his Wife.

Thank you honey, said Nasrudin.

As I told
you that Nasrudin liked going round, didn’t he?

He wasn’t
too long at home. Then he asked his wife permission.

Honey, I want to go out again, keep the house, said
Nasrudin

Yes, dear be careful !

Then
Nasrudin went out. But do yuo know after that when Nasrudin was out? His wife
didn’t make kabob for him, but she cooked the meat for making lunch for her
self and her friends instead. Was it a right behavior ? of course no ! It was a
big mistake for her. I think sinned against his husband, Nasrudin.

Then hours
latter, Nasrudin returned and asked whether the kabob was ready.

Honey ! have you finished making kabob? Is it ready now ? I’m
impatient to have it soon,

He
asked his wife.

You know
what about his wife? Of course she was very-very confuse how to answer her
husband’s question, because she has cooked the meat for her lunch and ate it up
with her friend.

Mmm mmm I’m sorry dear, she replied. But the cat ate it all while I was doing chores.

Oh no problem ! said Nasrudin.

Then
Nasrudin grabbed the cat and put it on the scale . And he spoke him self.

This cat weighs 2
kilos,
he remarked. “So if this is the cat, then where is
the beef? An if this the beef, then where is the cat? Oh I’m so confuse about
it.

And finally he said, “where is the beef? Where is
the cat? Where is the beef? Where is the cat? Where is the beef? Where is the
cat?, Until he felt sleep.

Ok, I think it’s all
my story and finally, let me say “Assalamu’alaikum Wr.Wb

They were very poor. The wife was very diligent, while the husband was very lazy. He just slept and slept everyday. He did not want to help his wife to earn a living. The wife was helpless, she often prayed to God to help her husband.<br />      One night the husband had a dream. In his dream, an old man came to him. He told the husband to take his sampan and went to river. "Go to the middle of the river and wait until a rope appears from the river. Take the rope slowly, and then you will find a golden chain. You can cut and take it, but don't take the chain too long," said the old man. The husband then woke up from his dream.<br />In the next day, the husband took his sampan and went to river. He wanted to do the old man's advice as said in his dream last night. "Where are you going?" asked the wife. She was so surprised to see her husband was busy preparing the sampan. "I want to go fishing, Honey. See you later!" the husband didn’t want to tell his wife about his dream. He knew his wife would think he was crazy by following up a dream.<br />      After the husband arrived in the river, he rowed his sampan until he reached the middle of the river. He then looked around the water surface very carefully. Suddenly a rope appeared from the river. "The old man was right!" said the husband to himself. He then slowly pulled the rope and at the end of the rope he saw a golden chain! The chain was sparkling and glowing. It was made from pure gold. "Wow! It’s really made of gold. I’m rich. I’m rich," the husband said happily. He kept pulling the chain. He forgot the old man's advice to take only short chain because it was enough for him. The poor man became greedy. He wanted to take the golden chain as long as possible.<br />     While he was busy pulling out the golden chain, a bird came to him. It talked, "Remember the old man's advice. Take only a short golden chain." But the poor man ignored the bird and kept on pulling out the chain. Slow but sure, his sampan was full of the golden chain. It was so full that finally the sampan could not hold the weight any more. The sampan started to drown. The golden chain was sinking and went to the bottom of the river creating a big wave in the river. The wave almost swallowed the poor man. He was so panicked. He swam as fast as possible to the river side.<br />      When he arrived on the river side, he felt sorry to himself. He blamed himself for being a greedy man. But it was already too late. But then he realized that it was a lesson for him to work hard if he wanted to earn money.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        Ini pengalaman waktu gua masuk Expo ya :D Oke langsung saja :<br /><br />Once upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatra lived a poor woman and his son. The boy was called as Malin Kundang. However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty.<br />“Mother, what if I sail overseas? if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” said Malin kundang to his mother.<br />His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life. But, promise me, you’ll come home.”<br />In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go.<br />“Ok mom I will go now… Please pray for me mom… See you mom… Bye…Bye…”“Ok Malin… Please take care of yourself. I will always pray for you my son… Good bye…”<br />One day, Malin kundang met a beautiful girl. She was the daughter of his master. They fell in love each other and got married.<br />After several years waiting without any news, Malin Kundang’s mother was suddenly surprised by the arrival of a big ship in the pier.<br />“Waw… What a big &amp; luxury ship…? Whose ship is that?”<br />When the ship finally pulled over, Malin Kundang’s mother saw a man who looked wealthy stepping down a ladder along with a beautiful woman.<br />Her blurry eyes still easily recognized him. The man was Malin Kundang, her son.<br />Do you think Malin Kundang will recognize her mother?<br />Malin Kundang’s mother quickly went to see her beloved son.<br />“Malin, you’re back, son!” said Malin Kundang's mother<br />But, Malin Kundang didn’t show any respond. He was ashamed to recognize his own mother in front of his beautiful wife.“You’re not my Mother. I don’t know you. My mother would never wear such ragged and ugly clothes,” said Malin Kundang.<br />“Malin… Don’t you  recognize me? I’m your mother!” she said sadly.<br />Malin Kundang’s face was as cold as ice and he said.“Guard, take this old woman out of here,and give her some money so she won’t disturb me again!”<br />”Malin… my son. Why do you treat your own mother like this?”"Go! And never once in a while you're annoying me and my wife," he shouted as he drove her mother .“Supercharge you Malin! I am your mother .. but why do not you recognize me?! You are really an ungrateful child ..Oh my God! If he is really my son,Curse him into a stone ...!" she said, cryingly<br />Suddenly, malin kundang’s whole body turned into stone. He was punished for not admitting his own mother.<br /><br />Bisa di tambah gambar juga loh :D<br />

                        Farmer and His Three Sons<br /><br />A farmer had three sons. They were all strong and young, but they never agreed with one another. They often quarreled among themselves. The farmer had given them a lot of advice, but they always turned a deaf ear. They disliked advice. The farmer felt very sad about it.<br /><br />The farmer was thinking hard and then he got a good idea. He called all of his sons and ordered them, “Bring me a few sticks.” Then, the farmer tied the sticks into a bundle.<br /><br />“Each of you, break this bundle of sticks said!” said the farmer to his sons. They did what their father said, but they could not break it. Then, the farmer untied the sticks and gave each of his sons a stick. Each of them broke the stick easily in the glance of an eye.<br /><br />“There you are, my sons!”, said the farmer. “If you remain united, you are strong. But if you quarrel with one another, you will be broken one by one easily. Do you understand what I mean?”<br /><br />At last, the advice worked out. They lived in harmony and united ever after. The farmer felt relieved. “Now I can die peacefully,” he whispered.<br /><br />Hello Friend, I Want To Tell You How To Install Aplication<br /> First: turn on your phone<br /> Second: open play store<br /> Third: search the aplication you want<br /> Fourth: klik install to install the aplication<br /> Finally: open the aplication<br />

                        Cerita rakyat from West Kalimantan
<br />The Origin of Landak River
<br />Long time ago, lived a farmer and his wife in a village by the side of a forest. They lived simply and they like to help other people, especially one who in afflictions. One night, the farmer and his wife were resting in their house. The farmer was sitting beside his sleeping wife. Suddenly, a white centipede came out from the wife’s head. The farmer was amazed. He then followed the centipede until they reach a small pond not far from their house. Then the centipede suddenly disappeared. The farmer went home and found his wife still soundly asleep.
<br />In the morning, the wife told his husband about the dream she had last night. “I was walking through a vast field, and I came to a lake. I saw a giant hedgehog in the lake. It was glaring at me, so I ran away.” After he heard his wife’s dream, the farmer went back to the small pond. In the pond, he saw something very shiny. He came to the shiny object and took it. It was a golden hedgehog statue. It was very beautiful. Its eyes were made of diamond. The farmer then brought the statue home.
<br />At night, the farmer had a dream. A giant hedgehog came to him, “Please let me stay in your home. As return, I will give you everything you want. Just caress the statue’s head and say the prayer. There are two kinds of prayers, one is to start your wish and the second is to stop your wish. Now memorize the prayers.”
<br />In the next day, the farmer told his wife about his dream. They really wanted to prove it. The farmer slowly caressed the statue's head. He said the prayer and asked for rice. Suddenly, rice came out of the mouth of the statue. The rice kept on coming out from the statue's mouth. The farmer immediately said the prayer to stop it. The rice then stopped coming out from the statue.
<br />The farmer and his wife then asked for other things, jewelry and other stuff they needed. They became very rich. But they still like to help other people. A lot of poor came to them for help. Unfortunately, a thief found out about the secret of the golden hedgehog statue. Pretending to be a poor asking for help, he stole the statue from the farmer’s house.
<br />The thief blurred to the district area of Ngabang. There was a drought in the area. The thief wanted sympathy from the people, so he said to them that he would provide them with water. The thief then caressed the hedgehog statue and said the prayer. Water came out of the statue’s mouth. All the people were so happy. But the water kept on coming out. The thief didn’t know the prayer to stop the wish. People who saw the incident were really scared. They ran away to avoid the water as it was started to flood the area. The thief also wanted to run away, but he cannot move his legs. In his vision, there was a giant hedgehog holding both his legs. Water kept coming from the statue and slowly it became a river. The thief was drowned in the river. People then named the river as Hedgehog River or Sungai Landak.***

                        I have a bet friend. one day, she told me not to see her, so i did. she told me not to text her, not to call herjust for a day, so i did. The next day, she told me not to see her for a week, so i did not see her, didn't text her, and just let her take her time. one week passed, but she told me again, that i shouldn't see her in a month. I was curious and suspicious, but i did as she asked. one month passed in silence, and i received a call. it's from the hospital. on the way to the hospital, someone stopped me and gave a letter. it says: "my dear best friend, i love you so much. i didn't tell you not to call me because i'm angry or resented, but i did this because i knew i wouldn't last long. you have endured times of not seeing me, a day, a week, a month, so can you endure longer? because you will never see me again, and i'm training you during those times to endure life without me. don't come to me, my body is hardening, turning blue. dont come close to me, because at that time, i won't be able to wipe the tears off your eyes. i'm sorry, i love you,"<br />

                        <p>Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city of Kioto. At such a great distance apart, they had never even heard of each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads at once that they should like to see a little of the world, and the frog who lived at Kioto wanted to visit Osaka, and the frog who lived at Osaka wished to go to Kioto, where the great Mikado had his palace.</p><p>So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led from Kioto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other. The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about travelling, and half way between the two towns there arose a mountain which had to be climbed. It took them a long time and a great many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to see another frog before him! They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from their homes. It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish--to learn a little more of their native country--and as there was no sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp place, and agreed that they would have a good rest before they parted to go their ways.</p><p>'What a pity we are not bigger,' said the Osaka frog; 'for then we could see both towns from here, and tell if it is worth our while going on.'</p><p>'Oh, that is easily managed,' returned the Kioto frog. 'We have only got to stand up on our hind legs, and hold on to each other, and then we can each look at the town he is travelling to.'</p><p>This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and put his front paws on the shoulders of his friend, who had risen also. There they both stood, stretching themselves as high as they could, and holding each other tightly, so that they might not fall down. The Kioto frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his nose towards Kioto; but the foolish things forgot that when they stood up their great eyes lay in the backs of their heads, and that though their noses might point to the places to which they wanted to go their eyes beheld the places from which they had come.</p><p>'Dear me!' cried the Osaka frog, 'Kioto is exactly like Osaka. It is certainly not worth such a long journey. I shall go home!'</p><p>'If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kioto I should never have travelled all this way,' exclaimed the frog from Kioto, and as he spoke he took his hands from his friend's shoulders, and they both fell down on the grass. Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and set off for home again, and to the end of their lives they believed that Osaka and Kioto, which are as different to look at as two towns can be, were as like as two peas.</p>two men were walking along one summer day. soon it became too hot to continue and on seeing a large pain tree nearrby, they threw themselves on the ground to rest in its shade. gazing up into the branches one man said to the other, "what a useless tree! it does not have fruit or nuts that we can eat and we cannot een use its wood for camping." the tree rustled in reply, "don't be so ungrateful. i am being extremely useful to you at this very moment, shielding you from the hot sun. you call me a good-for-nothing!"<br />

                        The Lonely Landy.
One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike. “Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day. “Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster. Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.” Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?” “Oh, nothing,” Landy replied. “Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes. Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!” “Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend. One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party. “I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it. Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball. Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away. “Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br />

                        At the end of World War II many Indonesians believed that independence was imminent. Few realised that it would be another five years of fighting before the country became a fully independent republic. The area around the east Javanese town of Surabaya became the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, and the Battle of Surabaya, which cost the lives of many thousands of Indonesians, became a symbol of resistance to the re-imposition of Dutch colonial rule. <br /><br />The future President Sukarno declared independence on 17 August 1945, and on 19 September, Dutch internees, with Japanese support, occupied the Oranje Hotel in Surabaya, and hoisted the Dutch flag. While this was taking place, young Indonesians were busily replacing Japanese flags in all the offices with Indonesian ones. <br /><br />When they heard what the Dutch had done, the Indonesians rushed to the hotel, and hand to hand fighting began with the Dutch, who were determined to defend their flag. Very soon shots were heard, and several people fell - both Dutch and Indonesian - as several Indonesian youths climed the flagpole and ripped the blue stripe off the Dutch flag. <br /><br />By the beginning of October, fierce fighting had broken out between the Indonesians and the Japanese, who refused to hand over their arms. The Indonesians managed to take possession of numerous buildings throughout Surabaya, and commandeered hundreds of cars and trucks to facilitate their movement throughout the town. <br /><br /><br />Then, on 25 October, some 6,000 British troops of the 49th Brigade of the 23rd Division under the command of Brigadier Mallaby, entered Surabaya. They had been ordered to organise the recovery of Allied prisoners-of-war, and the Indonesians were happy to co-operate. However, the British also sought to recapture Surabaya for the Dutch, and occupied key buildings and railway stations, and dropped leaflets over the town informing the populace that anyone seen bearing arms would be shot. <br /><br />The British had underestimated the extent of Indonesian resistance, and indeed the numbers involved. They found themselves up against a force of 20,000 troops of the newly-formed People's Security Army (Tentara Keamanan Rakyat), and over 100,000 irregular fighters, all dedicated to the cause of Indonesian independence. Fierce fighting broke out on 28 October, and soon the Indonesians had surrounded the eight British command posts scattered throughout the city. <br /><br />Faced with certain defeat, the British asked Jakarta to intervene, and the following day General Hawthorne, President Sukarno, and VP Hatta flew in to negotiate a truce. A truce was reached on 30 October, and the party from Jakarta left. An evacuation of the British to the harbour was arranged, but in the excitement and confusion, fighting erupted during which Brigadier Mallaby was killed. <br /><br />The British then decided to take Surabaya by force, and secretly landed 24,000 troops of the 5th Division, along with 24 Sherman tanks and the same number of armed aircraft, backed by a number of warships. <br /><br />On 9 November, the British gave the Indonesians an ultimatum, ordering their leaders to surrender. When they refused, bombs were dropped on Surabaya on 10 November, heralding a battle that was to last three weeks, at the end of which 200,000 of the town's population had fled, mainly old people, women and children. Over 16,000 Indonesian troops had been killed, and 2,000 British lives lost. <br /><br />Although the Indonesian resistance had been defeated, the Battle of Surabaya represented an important strategic victory for the Indonesians. It was also an important turning point for the Dutch, who until then had believed that the resistance had no popular support. The Battle of Surabaya shocked them into realising that they were no longer a colonial power.<br />
