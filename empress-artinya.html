                                            TEKS: The Old Woman Who Lived in a Vinegar Bottle (An English Tale) 
Once upon a time, there was an old woman who lived in a vinegar bottle. The old woman would often sit on her front steps and complain. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I live in a tiny house such as this? I should be living in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls.” 
One day, a fairy happened to be flying overhead and she heard the old woman’s complaint. “I can do that,” thought the fairy. “If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. In the morning, just see what you shall see.” 
The old woman thought the fairy was likely batty, but she decided to give it a try. When she went to bed that night, she turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again in the morning, she found herself in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls! 
“It’s just what I’ve always wanted,” she said. “I know I will be so happy here.” However, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. Then, the fairy left the woman to do all her duties. Suddenly, she began to think about that old woman. “I wonder how that old woman is getting along. The one who used to live in the vinegar bottle. I think I’ll just stop round and see.” When she arrived at the charming cottage, the fairy found the old woman sitting and complaining. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I have to live in a tiny cottage like this? 
I should be living in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do my bidding.” 
When the fairy heard this, she was much amazed. However, she decided to give the old woman what she desired. She asked the old woman to turn round three times and close her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do her bidding! Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy wandered but she began to think about her again. 
When she came to the mansion on the hilltop, she found the old woman in her velvet chair, sitting and complaining, “Oh, what a pity! I have to live in such a drafty old mansion. I should be living in the palace. Oh, yes, I should be the queen with musicians to entertain me and courtiers to bow to me.” 
“Good heavens,” thought the fairy. “Will she never be content? Well, if that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see!” 
The old woman could not wait to go to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in the palace and she was the queen, with musicians to entertain her and courtiers to bow to her. “Oh, yes! This is what I’ve always dreamed of. I know I will be so happy here!” Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy left the woman but then, she was curious about that old woman again. 
When she arrived at the palace, there sat the old woman on her throne, sitting and complaining, “Oh what a pity! I am only be the queen of such an insignificant little kingdom. I should be the empress of the universe. That’s what I really deserve!” 
“Well!” said the fairy. “There is just no pleasing some people! If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll not get!” To the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see.” 
The old woman hurried to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself right back in her vinegar bottle! 
“There she shall stay!” exclaimed the fairy. “If she can’t be happy here, she won’t be happy there. For, after all, happiness comes from the heart! Not from the house!”​</a>

Analyze the language feature of the biography recount text!Jean-Henry Dunant or Henry dunant (1828-1910) was a swiss businessman and social activist, the founder of the red cross, and the first recipient of the nobel peace price. Jean-Henry Dunant, who was born in Geneva on 8 May 1828, to a prosperous businessman named Jean)Jaques Dunant and a social activist named Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. After incomplete secondary schooling, he was apprenticed to a Geneva bank. In 1853, he travelled to Algeria to take charge of the Swiss colony of Sétif. He started construction of a wheat mill, but could not obtain the land concession that was essential for its operation. After travelling to Tunisia he returned to Geneva, where he decided to approach Napoleon III to obtain the business document he needed. At the time, the Emperor was commanding the Franco-Sardinian tr oops fighting the Austrians in northern Italy, and it was there that Henry Dunant decided to seek him out. This was how he came to be present at the end of the battle of Solferino, in Lombardy. Returning to Geneva, he wrote A Memory of Solferino , which eventually led to the creation of the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, the future International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Dunant was a member and acted as secretary. He was now famous and was received by heads of State, kings and princes of the European courts. But his financial affairs were floundering and he was declared bankrupt in 1867. Completely ruined, he was in debt for almost a million Swiss francs As a result of the scandal which this bankruptcy caused in Geneva, he resigned from his post as secretary of the International Committee. On 8 September 1867 the Committee decided to accept his resignation not only as secretary but also as a member. Dunant left for Paris, where he was reduced to sleeping on public benches. At the same time, however, the Empress Eugénie summoned him to the Tuileries Palace in order to consult him on extending the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Dunant was made an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, Holland, Sweden, Prussia and Spain. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he visited and comforted the wounded brought to Paris and introduced the wearing of a badge so that the dead could be identified. When peace returned, Dunant traveled to London, where he endeavored to organize a diplomatic conference on the problem of prisoners of war; the Tsar encouraged him but England was hostile to the plan. An international congress for the " complete and final abolition of the traffic in Negroes and the slave trade " opened in London on 1 February 1875, on Dunant's initiative. There followed years of wandering and utter poverty for Dunant: he traveled on foot in Alsace, Germany and Italy, living on charity and the hospitality of a few friends. Finally, in 1887, he ended up in the Swiss village of Heiden, overlooking Lake Constance, where he fell ill. He found refuge in the local hospice, and it was there that he was discovered in 1895 by a journalist, Georg Baumberger, who wrote an article about him which, within a few days, was reprinted in the press throughout Europe. Messages of sympathy reached Dunant from all over the world; overnight he was once more famous and honoured. In 1901, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Henry Dunant died on 30 October 1910. The date of his birth, 8 May, is celebrated as World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day.</a>

THE ENCHANTED KNIFE
Once upon a time there lived a young man who vowed that he would never marry any girl who had not royal blood in her veins. One day he plucked up all his courage and went to the palace to ask the emperor for his daughter. The emperor was not much pleased at the thought of such a match for his only child, but being very polite, he only said:
'Very well, my son, if you can win the princess you shall have her, and the conditions are these. In eight days you must manage to tame and bring to me three horses that have never felt a master. The first is pure white, the second a foxy-red with a black head, the third coal black with a white head and feet. And besides that, you must also bring as a present to the empress, my wife, as much gold as the three horses can carry.'
The young man listened in dismay to these words, but with an effort he thanked the emperor for his kindness and left the palace, wondering how he was to fulfil the task allotted to him. Luckily for him, the emperor's daughter had overheard everything her father had said, and peeping through a curtain had seen the youth, and thought him handsomer than anyone she had ever beheld.
So returning hastily to her own room, she wrote him a letter which she gave to a trusty servant to deliver, begging her wooer to come to her rooms early the next day, and to undertake nothing without her advice, if he ever wished her to be his wife.
That night, when her father was asleep, she crept softly into his chamber and took out an enchanted knife from the chest where he kept his treasures, and hid it carefully in a safe place before she went to bed.
The sun had hardly risen the following morning when the princess's nurse brought the young man to her apartments. Neither spoke for some minutes, but stood holding each other's hands for joy, till at last they both cried out that nothing but death should part them. Then the maiden said:
'Take my horse, and ride straight through the wood towards the sunset till you come to a hill with three peaks. When you get there, turn first to the right and then to the left, and you will find yourself in a sun meadow, where many horses are feeding. Out of these you must pick out the three described to you by my father. If they prove shy, and refuse to let you get near them, draw out your knife, and let the sun shine on it so that the whole meadow is lit up by its rays, and the horses will then approach you of their own accord, and will let you lead them away. When you have them safely, look about till you see a cypress tree, whose roots are of brass, whose boughs are of silver, and whose leaves are of gold. Go to it, and cut away the roots with your knife, and you will come to countless bags of gold. Load the horses with all they can carry, and return to my father, and tell him that you have done your task, and can claim me for your wife.'
The princess had finished all she had to say, and now it depended on the young man to do his part. He hid the knife in the folds of his girdle, mounted his horse, and rode off in search of the meadow. This he found without much difficulty, but the horses were all so shy that they galloped away directly he approached them. Then he drew his knife, and held it up towards the sun, and directly there shone such a glory that the whole meadow was bathed in it. From all sides the horses rushed pressing round, and each one that passed him fell on its knees to do him honour.
But he only chose from them all the three that the emperor had described. These he secured by a silken rope to his own horse, and then looked about for the cypress tree. It was standing by itself in one corner, and in a moment he was beside it, tearing away the earth with his knife. Deeper and deeper he dug, till far down, below the roots of brass, his knife struck upon the buried treasure, which lay heaped up in bags all around. With a great effort he lifted them from their hiding place, and laid them one by one on his horses' backs, and when they could carry no more he led them back to the emperor. And when the emperor saw him, he wondered, but never guessed how it was the young man had been too clever for him, till the betrothal ceremony was over. Then he asked his newly made son-in-law what dowry he would require with his bride. To which the bridegroom made answer, 'Noble emperor! all I desire is that I may have your daughter for my wife, and enjoy for ever the use of your enchanted knife.</a>

The old woman would often sit on her front steps and complain. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I live in a tiny house such as this? I should be living in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls.”One day, a fairy happened to be flying overhead and she heard the old woman’s complaint. “I can do that,” thought the fairy. “If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. In the morning, just see what you shall see.”The old woman thought the fairy was likely batty, but she decided to give it a try. When she went to bed that night, she turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again in the morning, she found herself in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls!“It’s just what I’ve always wanted,” she said. “I know I will be so happy here.” However, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. Then, the fairy left the woman to do all her duties. Suddenly, she began to think about that old woman. “I wonder how that old woman is getting along. The one who used to live in the vinegar bottle. I think I’ll just stop round and see.”When she arrived at the charming cottage, the fairy found the old woman sitting and complaining. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I have to live in a tiny cottage like this?I should be living in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do my bidding.”When the fairy heard this, she was much amazed. However, she decided to give the old woman what she desired. She asked the old woman to turn round three times and close her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do her bidding! Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy wandered but she began to think about her again.When she came to the mansion on the hilltop, she found the old woman in her velvet chair, sitting and complaining, “Oh, what a pity! I have to live in such a drafty old mansion. I should be living in the palace. Oh, yes, I should be the queen with musicians to entertain me and courtiers to bow to me.”“Good heavens,” thought the fairy. “Will she never be content? Well, if that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see!”The old woman could not wait to go to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in the palace and she was the queen, with musicians to entertain her and courtiers to bow to her. “Oh, yes! This is what I’ve always dreamed of.I know I will be so happy here!” Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy left the woman but then, she was curious about that old woman again.When she arrived at the palace, there sat the old woman on her throne, sitting and complaining, “Oh what a pity! I am only be the queen of such an insignificant little kingdom. I should be the empress of the universe. That’s what I really deserve!”“Well!” said the fairy. “There is just no pleasing some people! If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll not get!” To the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see.”The old woman hurried to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself right back in her vinegar bottle!“There she shall stay!” exclaimed the fairy. “If she can’t be happy here, she won’t be happy there. For, after all, happiness comes from the heart! Not from the house!”​Terjemahkan dlm bhs Indonesia.Please</a>

When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in the palace and she was the queen, with musicians to entertain her and courtiers to bow to her. “Oh, yes! This is what I’ve always dreamed of.I know I will be so happy here!” Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy left the woman but then, she was curious about that old woman again.When she arrived at the palace, there sat the old woman on her throne, sitting and complaining, “Oh what a pity! I am only be the queen of such an insignificant little kingdom. I should be the empress of the universe. That’s what I really deserve!”“Well!” said the fairy. “There is just no pleasing some people! If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll not get!” To the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see.”The old woman hurried to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself right back in her vinegar bottle!“There she shall stay!” exclaimed the fairy. “If she can’t be happy here, she won’t be happy there. For, after all, happiness comes from the heart! Not from the house!”​</a>

                                            The Fisherman and His WifeThere once was a poor fisherman who lived with his wife, Ilsebill, in a hovel by the sea. One day the fisherman catches a golden flounder who claims to be an enchanted prince. The fisherman kindly releases it. When his wife hears the story, she says she should have had the flounder grants him a wish. Ilsebill tells him to go back and ask the flounder to grant her wish for a nice house. The fisherman returns to the shore but is uneasy when he finds that the sea seems to be turning dark when it was so clear before. He makes up a rhyme to summon the flounder, and it grants the wife’s wish. However, the wife gets greedy and makes increasingly outrageous demands: a castle so she can become a queen, then empress and finally pope. The fisherman doesn’t think it a good way and knows this is wrong but there is no reasoning with his wife. The flounder grants the wishes, but the sea grows increasingly stormy every time the fisherman goes to summon it.Eventually, the wife goes too far when she wishes to become equal to God. The flounder revokes everything it granted, and the fisherman and his wife are back in their hovel.Where is the tale happen? *</a>

                            4. TEKS: The Old Woman Who Lived in a Vinegar Bottle (An English Tale) 
Once upon a time, there was an old woman who lived in a vinegar bottle. The old woman would often sit on her front steps and complain. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I live in a tiny house such as this? I should be living in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls.” 
One day, a fairy happened to be flying overhead and she heard the old woman’s complaint. “I can do that,” thought the fairy. “If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. In the morning, just see what you shall see.” 
The old woman thought the fairy was likely batty, but she decided to give it a try. When she went to bed that night, she turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again in the morning, she found herself in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls! 
“It’s just what I’ve always wanted,” she said. “I know I will be so happy here.” However, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. Then, the fairy left the woman to do all her duties. Suddenly, she began to think about that old woman. “I wonder how that old woman is getting along. The one who used to live in the vinegar bottle. I think I’ll just stop round and see.” When she arrived at the charming cottage, the fairy found the old woman sitting and complaining. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I have to live in a tiny cottage like this? 
I should be living in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do my bidding.” 
When the fairy heard this, she was much amazed. However, she decided to give the old woman what she desired. She asked the old woman to turn round three times and close her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do her bidding! Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy wandered but she began to think about her again. 
When she came to the mansion on the hilltop, she found the old woman in her velvet chair, sitting and complaining, “Oh, what a pity! I have to live in such a drafty old mansion. I should be living in the palace. Oh, yes, I should be the queen with musicians to entertain me and courtiers to bow to me.” 
“Good heavens,” thought the fairy. “Will she never be content? Well, if that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see!” 
The old woman could not wait to go to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in the palace and she was the queen, with musicians to entertain her and courtiers to bow to her. “Oh, yes! This is what I’ve always dreamed of. I know I will be so happy here!” Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy left the woman but then, she was curious about that old woman again. 
When she arrived at the palace, there sat the old woman on her throne, sitting and complaining, “Oh what a pity! I am only be the queen of such an insignificant little kingdom. I should be the empress of the universe. That’s what I really deserve!” 
“Well!” said the fairy. “There is just no pleasing some people! If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll not get!” To the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see.” 
The old woman hurried to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself right back in her vinegar bottle! 
“There she shall stay!” exclaimed the fairy. “If she can’t be happy here, she won’t be happy there. For, after all, happiness comes from the heart! Not from the house!”​</h2><br />

Jean-Henry Dunant, who was born in Geneva on 8 May 1828, to a prosperous businessman named Jean)Jaques Dunant and a social activist named Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. After incomplete secondary schooling, he was apprenticed to a Geneva bank. In 1853, he travelled to Algeria to take charge of the Swiss colony of Sétif. He started construction of a wheat mill, but could not obtain the land concession that was essential for its operation. After travelling to Tunisia he returned to Geneva, where he decided to approach Napoleon III to obtain the business document he needed. At the time, the Emperor was commanding the Franco-Sardinian tr oops fighting the Austrians in northern Italy, and it was there that Henry Dunant decided to seek him out. This was how he came to be present at the end of the battle of Solferino, in Lombardy. Returning to Geneva, he wrote A Memory of Solferino , which eventually led to the creation of the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, the future International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Dunant was a member and acted as secretary. He was now famous and was received by heads of State, kings and princes of the European courts. But his financial affairs were floundering and he was declared bankrupt in 1867. Completely ruined, he was in debt for almost a million Swiss francs As a result of the scandal which this bankruptcy caused in Geneva, he resigned from his post as secretary of the International Committee. On 8 September 1867 the Committee decided to accept his resignation not only as secretary but also as a member. Dunant left for Paris, where he was reduced to sleeping on public benches. At the same time, however, the Empress Eugénie summoned him to the Tuileries Palace in order to consult him on extending the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Dunant was made an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, Holland, Sweden, Prussia and Spain. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he visited and comforted the wounded brought to Paris and introduced the wearing of a badge so that the dead could be identified. When peace returned, Dunant traveled to London, where he endeavored to organize a diplomatic conference on the problem of prisoners of war; the Tsar encouraged him but England was hostile to the plan. An international congress for the " complete and final abolition of the traffic in Negroes and the slave trade " opened in London on 1 February 1875, on Dunant's initiative. There followed years of wandering and utter poverty for Dunant: he traveled on foot in Alsace, Germany and Italy, living on charity and the hospitality of a few friends. Finally, in 1887, he ended up in the Swiss village of Heiden, overlooking Lake Constance, where he fell ill. He found refuge in the local hospice, and it was there that he was discovered in 1895 by a journalist, Georg Baumberger, who wrote an article about him which, within a few days, was reprinted in the press throughout Europe. Messages of sympathy reached Dunant from all over the world; overnight he was once more famous and honoured. In 1901, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Henry Dunant died on 30 October 1910. The date of his birth, 8 May, is celebrated as World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day.</h2><br />

THE ENCHANTED KNIFE
Once upon a time there lived a young man who vowed that he would never marry any girl who had not royal blood in her veins. One day he plucked up all his courage and went to the palace to ask the emperor for his daughter. The emperor was not much pleased at the thought of such a match for his only child, but being very polite, he only said:
'Very well, my son, if you can win the princess you shall have her, and the conditions are these. In eight days you must manage to tame and bring to me three horses that have never felt a master. The first is pure white, the second a foxy-red with a black head, the third coal black with a white head and feet. And besides that, you must also bring as a present to the empress, my wife, as much gold as the three horses can carry.'
The young man listened in dismay to these words, but with an effort he thanked the emperor for his kindness and left the palace, wondering how he was to fulfil the task allotted to him. Luckily for him, the emperor's daughter had overheard everything her father had said, and peeping through a curtain had seen the youth, and thought him handsomer than anyone she had ever beheld.
So returning hastily to her own room, she wrote him a letter which she gave to a trusty servant to deliver, begging her wooer to come to her rooms early the next day, and to undertake nothing without her advice, if he ever wished her to be his wife.
That night, when her father was asleep, she crept softly into his chamber and took out an enchanted knife from the chest where he kept his treasures, and hid it carefully in a safe place before she went to bed.
The sun had hardly risen the following morning when the princess's nurse brought the young man to her apartments. Neither spoke for some minutes, but stood holding each other's hands for joy, till at last they both cried out that nothing but death should part them. Then the maiden said:
'Take my horse, and ride straight through the wood towards the sunset till you come to a hill with three peaks. When you get there, turn first to the right and then to the left, and you will find yourself in a sun meadow, where many horses are feeding. Out of these you must pick out the three described to you by my father. If they prove shy, and refuse to let you get near them, draw out your knife, and let the sun shine on it so that the whole meadow is lit up by its rays, and the horses will then approach you of their own accord, and will let you lead them away. When you have them safely, look about till you see a cypress tree, whose roots are of brass, whose boughs are of silver, and whose leaves are of gold. Go to it, and cut away the roots with your knife, and you will come to countless bags of gold. Load the horses with all they can carry, and return to my father, and tell him that you have done your task, and can claim me for your wife.'
The princess had finished all she had to say, and now it depended on the young man to do his part. He hid the knife in the folds of his girdle, mounted his horse, and rode off in search of the meadow. This he found without much difficulty, but the horses were all so shy that they galloped away directly he approached them. Then he drew his knife, and held it up towards the sun, and directly there shone such a glory that the whole meadow was bathed in it. From all sides the horses rushed pressing round, and each one that passed him fell on its knees to do him honour.
But he only chose from them all the three that the emperor had described. These he secured by a silken rope to his own horse, and then looked about for the cypress tree. It was standing by itself in one corner, and in a moment he was beside it, tearing away the earth with his knife. Deeper and deeper he dug, till far down, below the roots of brass, his knife struck upon the buried treasure, which lay heaped up in bags all around. With a great effort he lifted them from their hiding place, and laid them one by one on his horses' backs, and when they could carry no more he led them back to the emperor. And when the emperor saw him, he wondered, but never guessed how it was the young man had been too clever for him, till the betrothal ceremony was over. Then he asked his newly made son-in-law what dowry he would require with his bride. To which the bridegroom made answer, 'Noble emperor! all I desire is that I may have your daughter for my wife, and enjoy for ever the use of your enchanted knife.</h2><br />

The old woman would often sit on her front steps and complain. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I live in a tiny house such as this? I should be living in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls.”One day, a fairy happened to be flying overhead and she heard the old woman’s complaint. “I can do that,” thought the fairy. “If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. In the morning, just see what you shall see.”The old woman thought the fairy was likely batty, but she decided to give it a try. When she went to bed that night, she turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again in the morning, she found herself in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls!“It’s just what I’ve always wanted,” she said. “I know I will be so happy here.” However, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. Then, the fairy left the woman to do all her duties. Suddenly, she began to think about that old woman. “I wonder how that old woman is getting along. The one who used to live in the vinegar bottle. I think I’ll just stop round and see.”When she arrived at the charming cottage, the fairy found the old woman sitting and complaining. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I have to live in a tiny cottage like this?I should be living in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do my bidding.”When the fairy heard this, she was much amazed. However, she decided to give the old woman what she desired. She asked the old woman to turn round three times and close her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do her bidding! Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy wandered but she began to think about her again.When she came to the mansion on the hilltop, she found the old woman in her velvet chair, sitting and complaining, “Oh, what a pity! I have to live in such a drafty old mansion. I should be living in the palace. Oh, yes, I should be the queen with musicians to entertain me and courtiers to bow to me.”“Good heavens,” thought the fairy. “Will she never be content? Well, if that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see!”The old woman could not wait to go to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in the palace and she was the queen, with musicians to entertain her and courtiers to bow to her. “Oh, yes! This is what I’ve always dreamed of.I know I will be so happy here!” Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy left the woman but then, she was curious about that old woman again.When she arrived at the palace, there sat the old woman on her throne, sitting and complaining, “Oh what a pity! I am only be the queen of such an insignificant little kingdom. I should be the empress of the universe. That’s what I really deserve!”“Well!” said the fairy. “There is just no pleasing some people! If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll not get!” To the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see.”The old woman hurried to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself right back in her vinegar bottle!“There she shall stay!” exclaimed the fairy. “If she can’t be happy here, she won’t be happy there. For, after all, happiness comes from the heart! Not from the house!”​Terjemahkan dlm bhs Indonesia.Please</h2><br />

The old woman would often sit on her front steps and complain. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I live in a tiny house such as this? I should be living in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls.”One day, a fairy happened to be flying overhead and she heard the old woman’s complaint. “I can do that,” thought the fairy. “If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. In the morning, just see what you shall see.”The old woman thought the fairy was likely batty, but she decided to give it a try. When she went to bed that night, she turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again in the morning, she found herself in a charming cottage with a thatched roof and roses growing up the walls! “It’s just what I’ve always wanted,” she said. “I know I will be so happy here.” However, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. Then, the fairy left the woman to do all her duties. Suddenly, she began to think about that old woman. “I wonder how that old woman is getting along. The one who used to live in the vinegar bottle. I think I’ll just stop round and see.”When she arrived at the charming cottage, the fairy found the old woman sitting and complaining. “Oh, what a pity! Why do I have to live in a tiny cottage like this? I should be living in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do my bidding.”When the fairy heard this, she was much amazed. However, she decided to give the old woman what she desired. She asked the old woman to turn round three times and close her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in a mansion on a hilltop with a manservant and a maidservant to do her bidding! Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy wandered but she began to think about her again.When she came to the mansion on the hilltop, she found the old woman in her velvet chair, sitting and complaining, “Oh, what a pity! I have to live in such a drafty old mansion. I should be living in the palace. Oh, yes, I should be the queen with musicians to entertain me and courtiers to bow to me.” “Good heavens,” thought the fairy. “Will she never be content? Well, if that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.” Then, to the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see!”The old woman could not wait to go to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself in the palace and she was the queen, with musicians to entertain her and courtiers to bow to her. “Oh, yes! This is what I’ve always dreamed of.I know I will be so happy here!” Again, not a word of thanks did she give to the fairy. The fairy left the woman but then, she was curious about that old woman again.When she arrived at the palace, there sat the old woman on her throne, sitting and complaining, “Oh what a pity! I am only be the queen of such an insignificant little kingdom. I should be the empress of the universe. That’s what I really deserve!”“Well!” said the fairy. “There is just no pleasing some people! If that’s what she wants, that’s what she’ll not get!” To the old woman, she said, “When you go to bed tonight, turn round three times and close your eyes. When you open them again in the morning, just see what you shall see.”The old woman hurried to bed that night. She turned round three times and closed her eyes. When she opened them again the next morning, she found herself right back in her vinegar bottle!“There she shall stay!” exclaimed the fairy. “If she can’t be happy here, she won’t be happy there. For, after all, happiness comes from the heart! Not from the house!”​</h2><br />

When his wife hears the story, she says she should have had the flounder grants him a wish. Ilsebill tells him to go back and ask the flounder to grant her wish for a nice house. The fisherman returns to the shore but is uneasy when he finds that the sea seems to be turning dark when it was so clear before. He makes up a rhyme to summon the flounder, and it grants the wife’s wish. However, the wife gets greedy and makes increasingly outrageous demands: a castle so she can become a queen, then empress and finally pope. The fisherman doesn’t think it a good way and knows this is wrong but there is no reasoning with his wife. The flounder grants the wishes, but the sea grows increasingly stormy every time the fisherman goes to summon it.Eventually, the wife goes too far when she wishes to become equal to God. The flounder revokes everything it granted, and the fisherman and his wife are back in their hovel.Where is the tale happen? *</h2><br />

Ia kadang-kadang dijuluki "The Virgin Queen" (Ratu Perawan), "Gloriana", atau "Good Queen Bess". Elizabeth adalah penguasa monarki kelima dan terakhir dari Dinasti Tudor. Ia merupakan putri dari Henry VIII dan Anne Boleyn, tetapi ibunya dihukum mati dua setengah tahun setelah kelahirannya, dan pernikahan Anne dengan Henry VIII dibatalkan, sehingga Elizabeth dianggap sebagai anak yang tidak sah. Saudara tirinya, Edward VI, menjadi raja hingga kematiannya pada tahun 1553, dan sebelum meninggal ia menyerahkan takhta kepada Lady Jane Grey, yang bertentangan dengan undang-undang yang berlaku saat itu dan menyingkirkan Elizabeth dan Mary. Namun, keinginan Edward diabaikan; Mary menjadi ratu dan Lady Jane Grey dihukum mati. Pada tahun 1558, Elizabeth menggantikan saudara tirinya, walaupun sebelumnya Elizabeth dipenjara hampir selama setahun karena diduga mendukung pemberontak Protestan.</p><p>3. 1 Agustus 1714</p><p>4. 1 Desember 1135</p><p>5.
