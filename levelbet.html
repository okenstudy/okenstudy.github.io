                                            Tornado Wreaks Havoc in Semarang
Residents assess the damage after a tornado damages 150 houses in the district of Tembalag in Semarang, Central Java late on Saturday afternoon. 
Three people were injured and at least five of the houses in the Sendangguwo and Tandang neighborhoods were destroyed, while many others were seriously damaged as the tornado ripped off their roofs. Thoirin aka Jayeng, 40, a resident whose house was leveled at the Sendang Asri housing complex, said the winds hit about 4 p.m. 
“I saw this black wind coming and becoming pointed into a funnel. It suddenly approached and hit my house,” he said. 
Tohirin’s wife, two children and mother-in law were in the kitchen at the time when the tornado known locally as “Ulur-ulur” passed over their home, destroying the guest and bedrooms. 
“It was as if the wind had lifted my home up,” Thoirin said. 
The disaster also destroyed the walls of four neighboring houses. 
Many other homes in the area lost their roofs and residents and neighbors had started rebuilding on Sunday. 
Tembalang district head Dayat said the tornado also damaged a small mosque and felled power lines and about 50 trees. His office was still collecting data on the damage, he said.
Villagers said the tornado was the worst to hit the district in living memory. 
Semarang Mayor Sukawi Sutarip and his wife, Sinto Sukawi, visited the scene on Sunday, accompanied by senior officials. 
“We will provide the victims with assistance immediately,” the mayoral spokesman Achyani said.

Tornado Wreaks Havoc in Semarang
Residents assess the damage after a tornado damages 150 houses in the district of Tembalag in Semarang, Central Java late on Saturday afternoon.
Three people were injured and at least five of the houses in the Sendangguwo and Tandang neighborhoods were destroyed, while many others were seriously damaged as the tornado ripped off their roofs. Thoirin aka Jayeng, 40, a resident whose house was leveled at the Sendang Asri housing complex, said the winds hit about 4 p.m.
“I saw this black wind coming and becoming pointed into a funnel. It suddenly approached and hit my house,” he said.
Tohirin’s wife, two children and mother-in law were in the kitchen at the time when the tornado known locally as “Ulur-ulur” passed over their home, destroying the guest and bedrooms.
“It was as if the wind had lifted my home up,” Thoirin said.
The disaster also destroyed the walls of four neighboring houses.
Many other homes in the area lost their roofs and residents and neighbors had started rebuilding on Sunday.
Tembalang district head Dayat said the tornado also damaged a small mosque and felled power lines and about 50 trees. His office was still collecting data on the damage, he said.
Villagers said the tornado was the worst to hit the district in living memory.
Semarang Mayor Sukawi Sutarip and his wife, Sinto Sukawi, visited the scene on Sunday, accompanied by senior officials.
“We will provide the victims with assistance immediately,” the mayoral spokesman Achyani said.

                                            School Uniform, Another Good LessonSchool uniform is special clothes worn by all students of a particular school. The uniform of a school may differ from others. Why should schools use uniforms? Below are some reasons.First of all, Notre Dame‟s Department of Sociology produced a study in 1998 concerning school uniforms. Their findings using 10th grade students showed that uniforms have no direct effect on “substance abuse, behavioral problems or attendance.” It also claimed a negative effect on student achievements for those students considered „pro-school‟.Secondly, uniform helps to create a strong sense school ethos and a sense of belonging to a particular community. As such it promotes discipline and helps to drive up academic standards, which is why a uniform is often adopted by schools which are being reopened with a fresh startafter being classified as failing.Finally, uniform acts as a social leveler, under which all students are equal in the eyes of the school and of each other. In institutions without uniform students are often competitive and worry endlessly about their appearance and the clothes they should wear. Pupils without expensive designer clothes and trainers may be singled out as social outcasts, or stigmatized as being from poor backgrounds. For these reasons many parents prefer uniforms as they save them money on buying clothes forschool wear. Considering the findings, schools implement the uniform as their identity. The government also publish some kind of rule which makes uniform compulsory for schools.1. The government also publish some kind of rule …….(the last paragraph).

Fires rage across four Australian states
MELBOURNE, Jan 22 (UPI) – Fire authorities in four Australian states are to control bushfires fanned by strong winds and searing temperatures.
      The Australian reported Sunday that blazes continued to burn in South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria, where up to six homes have been destroyed. In South Australia, much of Adelaide is engulfed in thick smoke. The firefighters who are confronted by blast-furnace winds try to bring the flames under control.
      At Robertstown in the state’s mid-north, more than 2,500 acres have already burned. Another bushfire, started by lightning, charred the earth near mouth Flat on the southern side of Kangoroo Island, while Ngarkat Conservation Park, in the state’s upper-southeast, is also a blaze.
      A 7,500-acres fire at mount Agnew inZeehan, in the state’s west, broke containment lines Saturday afternoon, jumping a road and coming close to homes.
      The most serious fires were in Victoria, where up six homes were destroyed by a fire near the town of Anakie, 36 miles west of Melbourne.
      In Tasmania, falling temperatures and patchy rain brought some relief to firefighters, who continued to monitor 22 blazes across the state.

Tornado Wreaks Havoc in Semarang
Residents assess the damage after a tornado damages 150 houses in the district of Tembalag in Semarang, Central Java late on Saturday afternoon.
Three people were injured and at least five of the houses in the Sendangguwo and Tandang neighborhoods were destroyed, while many others were seriously damaged as the tornado ripped off their roofs. Thoirin aka Jayeng, 40, a resident whose house was leveled at the Sendang Asri housing complex, said the winds hit about 4 p.m.
“I saw this black wind coming and becoming pointed into a funnel. It suddenly approached and hit my house,” he said.
Tohirin’s wife, two children and mother-in law were in the kitchen at the time when the tornado known locally as “Ulur-ulur” passed over their home, destroying the guest and bedrooms.
“It was as if the wind had lifted my home up,” Thoirin said.
The disaster also destroyed the walls of four neighboring houses.
Many other homes in the area lost their roofs and residents and neighbors had started rebuilding on Sunday.
Tembalang district head Dayat said the tornado also damaged a small mosque and felled power lines and about 50 trees. His office was still collecting data on the damage, he said.

                            7. Tornado Wreaks Havoc in Semarang
Residents assess the damage after a tornado damages 150 houses in the district of Tembalag in Semarang, Central Java late on Saturday afternoon. 
Three people were injured and at least five of the houses in the Sendangguwo and Tandang neighborhoods were destroyed, while many others were seriously damaged as the tornado ripped off their roofs. Thoirin aka Jayeng, 40, a resident whose house was leveled at the Sendang Asri housing complex, said the winds hit about 4 p.m. 
“I saw this black wind coming and becoming pointed into a funnel. It suddenly approached and hit my house,” he said. 
Tohirin’s wife, two children and mother-in law were in the kitchen at the time when the tornado known locally as “Ulur-ulur” passed over their home, destroying the guest and bedrooms. 
“It was as if the wind had lifted my home up,” Thoirin said. 
The disaster also destroyed the walls of four neighboring houses. 
Many other homes in the area lost their roofs and residents and neighbors had started rebuilding on Sunday. 
Tembalang district head Dayat said the tornado also damaged a small mosque and felled power lines and about 50 trees. His office was still collecting data on the damage, he said.
Villagers said the tornado was the worst to hit the district in living memory. 
Semarang Mayor Sukawi Sutarip and his wife, Sinto Sukawi, visited the scene on Sunday, accompanied by senior officials. 
“We will provide the victims with assistance immediately,” the mayoral spokesman Achyani said.

                            14. School Uniform, Another Good LessonSchool uniform is special clothes worn by all students of a particular school. The uniform of a school may differ from others. Why should schools use uniforms? Below are some reasons.First of all, Notre Dame‟s Department of Sociology produced a study in 1998 concerning school uniforms. Their findings using 10th grade students showed that uniforms have no direct effect on “substance abuse, behavioral problems or attendance.” It also claimed a negative effect on student achievements for those students considered „pro-school‟.Secondly, uniform helps to create a strong sense school ethos and a sense of belonging to a particular community. As such it promotes discipline and helps to drive up academic standards, which is why a uniform is often adopted by schools which are being reopened with a fresh startafter being classified as failing.Finally, uniform acts as a social leveler, under which all students are equal in the eyes of the school and of each other. In institutions without uniform students are often competitive and worry endlessly about their appearance and the clothes they should wear. Pupils without expensive designer clothes and trainers may be singled out as social outcasts, or stigmatized as being from poor backgrounds. For these reasons many parents prefer uniforms as they save them money on buying clothes forschool wear. Considering the findings, schools implement the uniform as their identity. The government also publish some kind of rule which makes uniform compulsory for schools.1. The government also publish some kind of rule …….(the last paragraph).

Fires rage across four Australian states
MELBOURNE, Jan 22 (UPI) – Fire authorities in four Australian states are to control bushfires fanned by strong winds and searing temperatures.
      The Australian reported Sunday that blazes continued to burn in South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria, where up to six homes have been destroyed. In South Australia, much of Adelaide is engulfed in thick smoke. The firefighters who are confronted by blast-furnace winds try to bring the flames under control.
      At Robertstown in the state’s mid-north, more than 2,500 acres have already burned. Another bushfire, started by lightning, charred the earth near mouth Flat on the southern side of Kangoroo Island, while Ngarkat Conservation Park, in the state’s upper-southeast, is also a blaze.
      A 7,500-acres fire at mount Agnew inZeehan, in the state’s west, broke containment lines Saturday afternoon, jumping a road and coming close to homes.
      The most serious fires were in Victoria, where up six homes were destroyed by a fire near the town of Anakie, 36 miles west of Melbourne.
      In Tasmania, falling temperatures and patchy rain brought some relief to firefighters, who continued to monitor 22 blazes across the state.
