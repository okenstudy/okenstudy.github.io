It was one of the m important turning points in the political history of the nineteenth-century Java and Javanese history as a whole. The war determined the increasing glory of Ja colonial government and the inevitable retrenchment of local powers. The problems started when a long-standing conflict between the elites of the Yogyakarta Sultanate of Central Java became more heated as a transition of heir occurred during the British interregnum. The reappointed Sultan Hamengkubuwono II, after being förced to resign by the French-Dutch representative, enjoyed only one year of rule. The British then appointed a new sultan, Hamengkubuwono III, in 1812 and banished Hamengkubuwono ll to the Island of Penang, off the coast of the Malay Peninsula. At the same time, the Introduction of a land-tax system by Stamford Raftles (1781-1826), along with the government's practice of administering tollgates by subcontracting through three to four Chinese tax-farmers, created more tension because the abuses of the traditional services system by local Javanese officials continued. People were further impoverished by various kinds of indirect taxes that were monopolized by Chinese bookies. Goldsmiths, coppersmiths, copper workers, and even the owners of Javanese musical orchestras, for example,had to pay an annual tax to the boökie, or they were sent to jail.In the beginning of 1825, the policies of the colonlal and sultanate elite did Increasing damage to Diponegoro. For example, the government placed poles to designate the location of a planned new road that passed directly through Diponegoro's property without his permission. The event resulted in a spontaneous mobilization of people to defend Diponegoro's rights in mid-July 1825. Battles between the Dutch army, supported by local rulers, against the des supporters of Diponegoro Kedu, especially in the areas around the Menoreh Mountains, Bagelen, and Banyumas. The widespread support of the Javanese people for Diponegoro could not he underestimated. Although the Islamic groups became his main supporters, the largest war in Java's history also involved many other groups, from farmers to noblemen, from clergy to bandits. Furthermore, the soldiers called to the fieid of battles did not consist of men only: many of Diponegoro's troops were women, and it is known that at least one of his daughters became a commandant. By mid-1829, all of Diponegoro's most important supporters-Dullah Haji Abdulkadir, Pangeran Bei, Pangeran Joyokusumi, Pangeran Adikusumo, and Raden Basah Prawirodirjo-had either been captured or had surrendered. Diponegoro decided to stop the war in February 1830, and he commenced with negotiation.Diponegoro was invited to the Dutch resident's house in Magelang on March 8, 1830. He was captured on March 28, 1830 during the negotiations and was exiled to Manado, North Sulawesi. Diponegoro was later transferred to Makassar, South Sulawesi, where he remained until his death on January 8, 1855. During his years of exile, Diponegoro produced many works of literature on Java and Islam The Java War caused the victims of more than 200,000 Javanese. Meanwhile the Dutch lost more than 8,000 European soldiers and 7,000 local soldiers; and not less than twenty million guilders were spent to finance the five-year warFrom the Javanese perspective, the Diponegoro War was the end of the Javanese effort to combat the colonial intervention and restore the greatness of Java, greatness tattered since the coming of the Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC, or Dutch East India Company), Thereafter, the Javanese struggle sporadically disconnected from the activities in its center of power. The war can also be seen as the first major war against the Dutch involving Javanese leaders who were motivated by social and ecanomic reasons, rather than the usual dynastic reasons that had caused earlier conflicts in Java.

It was one of the m important turning points in the political history of the nineteenth-century Java and Javanese history as a whole. The war determined the increasing glory of Ja colonial government and the inevitable retrenchment of local powers. The problems started when a long-standing conflict between the elites of the Yogyakarta Sultanate of Central Java became more heated as a transition of heir occurred during the British interregnum. The reappointed Sultan Hamengkubuwono II, after being förced to resign by the French-Dutch representative, enjoyed only one year of rule. The British then appointed a new sultan, Hamengkubuwono III, in 1812 and banished Hamengkubuwono ll to the Island of Penang, off the coast of the Malay Peninsula. At the same time, the Introduction of a land-tax system by Stamford Raftles (1781-1826), along with the government's practice of administering tollgates by subcontracting through three to four Chinese tax-farmers, created more tension because the abuses of the traditional services system by local Javanese officials continued. People were further impoverished by various kinds of indirect taxes that were monopolized by Chinese bookies. Goldsmiths, coppersmiths, copper workers, and even the owners of Javanese musical orchestras, for example,had to pay an annual tax to the boökie, or they were sent to jail.In the beginning of 1825, the policies of the colonlal and sultanate elite did Increasing damage to Diponegoro. For example, the government placed poles to designate the location of a planned new road that passed directly through Diponegoro's property without his permission. The event resulted in a spontaneous mobilization of people to defend Diponegoro's rights in mid-July 1825. Battles between the Dutch army, supported by local rulers, against the des supporters of Diponegoro Kedu, especially in the areas around the Menoreh Mountains, Bagelen, and Banyumas. The widespread support of the Javanese people for Diponegoro could not he underestimated. Although the Islamic groups became his main supporters, the largest war in Java's history also involved many other groups, from farmers to noblemen, from clergy to bandits. Furthermore, the soldiers called to the fieid of battles did not consist of men only: many of Diponegoro's troops were women, and it is known that at least one of his daughters became a commandant. By mid-1829, all of Diponegoro's most important supporters-Dullah Haji Abdulkadir, Pangeran Bei, Pangeran Joyokusumi, Pangeran Adikusumo, and Raden Basah Prawirodirjo-had either been captured or had surrendered. Diponegoro decided to stop the war in February 1830, and he commenced with negotiation.Diponegoro was invited to the Dutch resident's house in Magelang on March 8, 1830. He was captured on March 28, 1830 during the negotiations and was exiled to Manado, North Sulawesi. Diponegoro was later transferred to Makassar, South Sulawesi, where he remained until his death on January 8, 1855. During his years of exile, Diponegoro produced many works of literature on Java and Islam The Java War caused the victims of more than 200,000 Javanese. Meanwhile the Dutch lost more than 8,000 European soldiers and 7,000 local soldiers; and not less than twenty million guilders were spent to finance the five-year warFrom the Javanese perspective, the Diponegoro War was the end of the Javanese effort to combat the colonial intervention and restore the greatness of Java, greatness tattered since the coming of the Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC, or Dutch East India Company), Thereafter, the Javanese struggle sporadically disconnected from the activities in its center of power. The war can also be seen as the first major war against the Dutch involving Javanese leaders who were motivated by social and ecanomic reasons, rather than the usual dynastic reasons that had caused earlier conflicts in Java.
