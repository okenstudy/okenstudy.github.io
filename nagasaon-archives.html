                                            ada studi kasus seperti ini.Case study: Dharamsala Community Wireless Mesh NetworkThe Dharamsala Wireless-Mesh Community Network came to life in Febru- ary 2005, following the deregulation of WiFi for outdoor use in India. By the end of February 2005, the mesh had already connected 8 campuses.Extensive testing during February of 2005 showed that the hard mountainous terrain is most suitable for mesh networking, as conventional point-to- multipoint networks, cannot overcome the line-of-sight limitations presented by the mountains. mesh topology also offered much larger area coverage, while the “self healing” nature of mesh routing, proved to be essential in places where electricity supply is very erratic at best.The mesh backbone includes over 30 nodes, all sharing a single radio channel. Broadband Internet services are provided to all mesh members. The total up- stream Internet bandwidth available is 6 Mbps. There are over 2,000 computers connected to the mesh, The broadband internet connection is putting the mesh under great load. At present, the system seems to handle the load without any increase in latency or packet-loss. It is clear that scalability will become an issue if we continue to use a single radio channel. To solve this problem, new mesh routers with multiple radio channel support are being developed and tested in Dharamsala, with an emphasis on products that meet our technical require- ments and our economically viable. The initial results are very promising.The mesh network is based on recurring deployments of a hardware device, which is designed and built locally – known as the Himalayan-Mesh-Router332 Chapter 11: Case Studies(http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/9). The same mesh-routers are installed at every location, with only different antennas, depending on the geographical locations and needs. We use a wide range of antennas, from 8 - 11 dBi om- nidirectional, to 12 - 24 dBi directional antennas and occasionally some high- gain (and cost) sector antennas.The mesh is primarily used for:• Internet access • File-sharing applications • Off-site backups • Playback of high quality video from remote archives.A central VoIP, software-based PBX is installed (Asterisk) and it provides ad- vanced telephony services to members. The Asterisk PBX is also interfacing the PSTN telephone network. However, due to legal issues it is presently used only for incoming calls into the mesh. Subscribers use a large variety of software-phones, as well as numerous ATAs (Analog Telephone Adaptors) and full-featured IP phones.The encrypted mesh back-bone does not allow access to roaming mobile devices (notebooks and PDAs), so we have placed multiple 802.11b access- points at many of the same locations where mesh-routers are installed. The mesh provides the backbone infrastructure while these APs provide access to mobile roaming devices, where needed.Access to the mesh back-bone is only possible by mesh-routers. Simple wireless clients lack the intelligence needed to “speak” the mesh routing pro- tocols and strict access policies. The mesh channel is therefore encrypted (WPA), and also “hidden” to prevent mobile devices from nding it or attempt- ing to access it. Allowing access to the mesh only by mesh-routers allows for strict access control policies and limitations to be enforced at the CPE (Client Premises Equipment) which is a crucial element needed to achieve end-to- end security, trafc-shaping, and quality-of-service.Power consumption of the mesh-Router is less than 4 Watts. This makes them ideal for using with solar panels. Many of the Dharamsala Mesh routers are powered solely by small solar panels. The use of solar power in combina- tion with small antennas and low power routers is ideally suitable for disaster areas, as it very likely to survive when all other communication infrastructure is damaged.Pertanyaan, bagaimana kita menanggapi dari sisi ilmu ekonomi kasus di atas?</a>

                                            Text 1 Fort Rotterdam is located in the center of Makassar city. It was originally built in the 16th century by a sultan of Gowa-Tallo for a defense against the Dutch attack and was called Jum Pandan. However, the Sultanate later fell into Dutch occupation and the fort was renovated into a bigger and stronger fort. The renovation was done using karst, limestone, and timber from nearby area. It was renamed as Fort Rotterdam, after Dutch admiral Speelman's birthplace. It was then become the center of Dutch power in Sulawesi. Standing majestically at the western coast of Makassar, South Sulawesi , Fort Rotterdam is Source: as the city's most iconic landmark. Inside the fort, there are thirteen buildings. At the centre of the fort is a church building. Several buildings along the north and south curtain walls still exist. Visitors can also visit a museum, called the La Galigo Museum. It is a place to store various historical objects about humans in ancient times. The buildings on the south curtain house a museum boats. The barracks on the eastern wall now house a small library. There are also ships' logs of VOC captains and ancient lontar manuscripts. The department of archaeology is housed in the former building of the head of administration for the VOC. The southwestern Bastion contains a prison where Prince Diponegoro was imprisoned at the end of his life. Currently Fort Rotterdam is still standing strong and open to public. It is now not only as a tourist attraction and becomes the icon of the city of Makassar, but also as a place to carry out various events. Today, the buildings contain the national archives, the historical and archaeological institute, conservatory of dance and music, art development services and the state museum. Questions: 5.

                                            Questions 33-42
When parchment, which was extraordinarily costly, was
replaced by papyrus, it became feasible to establish libraries. The
onset, they became as archives for record keeping and document
storage. According to second-hand reports, the most renowned
papyrus library
was the Alexandrian, founded by Alexander the Great around 330
B.C. in Alexandria, Egypt. His successors as rulers of Egypt
Ptolemy one and Ptolemy two, expanded the library into the greatest
collections of scrolls in the ancient world. To acquire this collection
the rulers borrowed scrolls and manuscripts from libraries in Athens,
Rome, and other localities and ordered them duplicated. At times,
the library employed more than 100 scribes and illustrators. Some
historians claim that the Alexandrian library purchased entire lesser
libraries to
contribute to enhance the quality of its possessions.
The library owned a copy of every contemporary scroll
known to the library’s administrators and contained more than
400,000 items, all of which were classified and organized. The
contents of the papyrus scrolls were edited, and bibliography of
Greek literature was compiled and cross-referenced, reflecting the
emergence and dissemination of a highly developed Greek culture.
Overtime, a succession of leading scholars directed this library,
which was acclaimed for the scholarly undertakings it supported as
well as for the size of its collection. At one time, 72 scholars were
engaged to translate religious testaments, historical annals,
mercantile accounts. Although the library flourished, it was
accessible to only a
minority of the population because in ancient times the vast majority
of urban dwellers were illiterate. Because papyrus was extremely
perishable, not a trace of the Alexandrian library remains today, and
archaeologists have several hypotheses as to what became of it.

                                            A VARIETY of factors such as social policy changes, deinstitutionalization, and treatment advances have all contributed to the increased number of mentally ill individuals living in the community. As a result, families are often challenged to assume various caregiving responsibilities for members diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Although there is a growing body of research illuminating the burden of mental illness on the family (Cook, Hoffschmidt, Cohler, &amp; Pickett, 1992; Fadden, Bebbington, &amp; Kulpers, 1987; Jacob, Frank, Kupfer, &amp; Carpenter, 1987; Jennings, 1987; Lefley, 1987a; Lefley, 1987b; Lefley, 1989; Parks &amp; Pilisuk, 1991; Maurin &amp; Boyd, 1990), there is limited information on grief experienced in families of seriously mentally ill individuals (Atkinson, 1994; Miller, Dworkin, Ward, &amp; Barone, 1990; Titetman &amp; Psyk, 1991). It is true that persons with chronic mental illnesses generally do not die from them, but they must confront multiple losses, both actual and symbolic, associated with their illnesses. It might be expected that family members would also experience these stresses and sorrows as they struggle with the chronic mental illness of a loved one. In an early exploration of the grieving process in families living with dementia, Kapust (1982) compares the experience with an "ongoing funeral." Noting her observations of the family's struggle, she comments (pg. 79): Gone is the patient's ability to work and to love. Only fragments of familiar behavior and personality remain as sorrowful reminders to the family of what has been lost. The healthy spouse and family experience life as an ongoing funeral; the person they once knew is dying, a little at a time. The family grieves for the losses, yet there are no formalized rituals to help them through this time. Kapust goes on to say that psychological closure and acceptance necessary for healthy resolution of the grieving process is not possible for demented patients and their families. More recently, Miller et al. (1990) conducted a preliminary study of unresolved grief in families of seriously mentally ill patients.

The advantages of digital libraries as a means of easily and rapidly accessing books, archives and images of various types are now widely recognized by commercial interest and public bodies alike. Traditional libraries are limited by storage space; digital libraries have the potential to store much more information, simply because digital information requires very little physical space to contain it. As such, the cost of maintaining a digital library is much lower than that of a traditional library.</a>

   john cabot was the first englisman to land in north America. However, this man who legitmized England's claim to everything from labrador to florida, left no sea journal, no diary or log, not even a portrait or a signature. Until 1956 most learned encyclopedias and histories indicated that Cabot'a first landfall in America was Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Then a letter was discovered in the Spanish archives, making it almost certain  that he had touched first at the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, within five miles of the site of leif  Ericson's ill-fated settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows. Researchers studying the voyages  of Columbus,  Cartier,Frobisher, and other early explorers had a wealth of firsthand material with which to work. Those who seek to recreate  the life and routes used by Cabot must make do with thirdhand accounts, the diloyal and untruthful boasts of his son, Sebastian, and a few hard dates in the maritime records  of Bristol, England

                            4. ada studi kasus seperti ini.Case study: Dharamsala Community Wireless Mesh NetworkThe Dharamsala Wireless-Mesh Community Network came to life in Febru- ary 2005, following the deregulation of WiFi for outdoor use in India. By the end of February 2005, the mesh had already connected 8 campuses.Extensive testing during February of 2005 showed that the hard mountainous terrain is most suitable for mesh networking, as conventional point-to- multipoint networks, cannot overcome the line-of-sight limitations presented by the mountains. mesh topology also offered much larger area coverage, while the “self healing” nature of mesh routing, proved to be essential in places where electricity supply is very erratic at best.The mesh backbone includes over 30 nodes, all sharing a single radio channel. Broadband Internet services are provided to all mesh members. The total up- stream Internet bandwidth available is 6 Mbps. There are over 2,000 computers connected to the mesh, The broadband internet connection is putting the mesh under great load. At present, the system seems to handle the load without any increase in latency or packet-loss. It is clear that scalability will become an issue if we continue to use a single radio channel. To solve this problem, new mesh routers with multiple radio channel support are being developed and tested in Dharamsala, with an emphasis on products that meet our technical require- ments and our economically viable. The initial results are very promising.The mesh network is based on recurring deployments of a hardware device, which is designed and built locally – known as the Himalayan-Mesh-Router332 Chapter 11: Case Studies(http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/9). The same mesh-routers are installed at every location, with only different antennas, depending on the geographical locations and needs. We use a wide range of antennas, from 8 - 11 dBi om- nidirectional, to 12 - 24 dBi directional antennas and occasionally some high- gain (and cost) sector antennas.The mesh is primarily used for:• Internet access • File-sharing applications • Off-site backups • Playback of high quality video from remote archives.A central VoIP, software-based PBX is installed (Asterisk) and it provides ad- vanced telephony services to members. The Asterisk PBX is also interfacing the PSTN telephone network. However, due to legal issues it is presently used only for incoming calls into the mesh. Subscribers use a large variety of software-phones, as well as numerous ATAs (Analog Telephone Adaptors) and full-featured IP phones.The encrypted mesh back-bone does not allow access to roaming mobile devices (notebooks and PDAs), so we have placed multiple 802.11b access- points at many of the same locations where mesh-routers are installed. The mesh provides the backbone infrastructure while these APs provide access to mobile roaming devices, where needed.Access to the mesh back-bone is only possible by mesh-routers. Simple wireless clients lack the intelligence needed to “speak” the mesh routing pro- tocols and strict access policies. The mesh channel is therefore encrypted (WPA), and also “hidden” to prevent mobile devices from nding it or attempt- ing to access it. Allowing access to the mesh only by mesh-routers allows for strict access control policies and limitations to be enforced at the CPE (Client Premises Equipment) which is a crucial element needed to achieve end-to- end security, trafc-shaping, and quality-of-service.Power consumption of the mesh-Router is less than 4 Watts. This makes them ideal for using with solar panels. Many of the Dharamsala Mesh routers are powered solely by small solar panels. The use of solar power in combina- tion with small antennas and low power routers is ideally suitable for disaster areas, as it very likely to survive when all other communication infrastructure is damaged.Pertanyaan, bagaimana kita menanggapi dari sisi ilmu ekonomi kasus di atas?</h2><br />

It was originally built in the 16th century by a sultan of Gowa-Tallo for a defense against the Dutch attack and was called Jum Pandan. However, the Sultanate later fell into Dutch occupation and the fort was renovated into a bigger and stronger fort. The renovation was done using karst, limestone, and timber from nearby area. It was renamed as Fort Rotterdam, after Dutch admiral Speelman's birthplace. It was then become the center of Dutch power in Sulawesi. Standing majestically at the western coast of Makassar, South Sulawesi , Fort Rotterdam is Source: as the city's most iconic landmark. Inside the fort, there are thirteen buildings. At the centre of the fort is a church building. Several buildings along the north and south curtain walls still exist. Visitors can also visit a museum, called the La Galigo Museum. It is a place to store various historical objects about humans in ancient times. The buildings on the south curtain house a museum boats. The barracks on the eastern wall now house a small library.

                            6. Questions 33-42
When parchment, which was extraordinarily costly, was
replaced by papyrus, it became feasible to establish libraries. The
onset, they became as archives for record keeping and document
storage. According to second-hand reports, the most renowned
papyrus library
was the Alexandrian, founded by Alexander the Great around 330
B.C. in Alexandria, Egypt. His successors as rulers of Egypt
Ptolemy one and Ptolemy two, expanded the library into the greatest
collections of scrolls in the ancient world. To acquire this collection
the rulers borrowed scrolls and manuscripts from libraries in Athens,
Rome, and other localities and ordered them duplicated. At times,
the library employed more than 100 scribes and illustrators. Some
historians claim that the Alexandrian library purchased entire lesser
libraries to
contribute to enhance the quality of its possessions.
The library owned a copy of every contemporary scroll
known to the library’s administrators and contained more than
400,000 items, all of which were classified and organized. The
contents of the papyrus scrolls were edited, and bibliography of
Greek literature was compiled and cross-referenced, reflecting the
emergence and dissemination of a highly developed Greek culture.
Overtime, a succession of leading scholars directed this library,
which was acclaimed for the scholarly undertakings it supported as
well as for the size of its collection. At one time, 72 scholars were
engaged to translate religious testaments, historical annals,
mercantile accounts. Although the library flourished, it was
accessible to only a
minority of the population because in ancient times the vast majority
of urban dwellers were illiterate. Because papyrus was extremely
perishable, not a trace of the Alexandrian library remains today, and
archaeologists have several hypotheses as to what became of it.

                            8. A VARIETY of factors such as social policy changes, deinstitutionalization, and treatment advances have all contributed to the increased number of mentally ill individuals living in the community. As a result, families are often challenged to assume various caregiving responsibilities for members diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Although there is a growing body of research illuminating the burden of mental illness on the family (Cook, Hoffschmidt, Cohler, &amp; Pickett, 1992; Fadden, Bebbington, &amp; Kulpers, 1987; Jacob, Frank, Kupfer, &amp; Carpenter, 1987; Jennings, 1987; Lefley, 1987a; Lefley, 1987b; Lefley, 1989; Parks &amp; Pilisuk, 1991; Maurin &amp; Boyd, 1990), there is limited information on grief experienced in families of seriously mentally ill individuals (Atkinson, 1994; Miller, Dworkin, Ward, &amp; Barone, 1990; Titetman &amp; Psyk, 1991). It is true that persons with chronic mental illnesses generally do not die from them, but they must confront multiple losses, both actual and symbolic, associated with their illnesses. It might be expected that family members would also experience these stresses and sorrows as they struggle with the chronic mental illness of a loved one. In an early exploration of the grieving process in families living with dementia, Kapust (1982) compares the experience with an "ongoing funeral." Noting her observations of the family's struggle, she comments (pg. 79): Gone is the patient's ability to work and to love. Only fragments of familiar behavior and personality remain as sorrowful reminders to the family of what has been lost. The healthy spouse and family experience life as an ongoing funeral; the person they once knew is dying, a little at a time. The family grieves for the losses, yet there are no formalized rituals to help them through this time. Kapust goes on to say that psychological closure and acceptance necessary for healthy resolution of the grieving process is not possible for demented patients and their families. More recently, Miller et al. (1990) conducted a preliminary study of unresolved grief in families of seriously mentally ill patients.

The advantages of digital libraries as a means of easily and rapidly accessing books, archives and images of various types are now widely recognized by commercial interest and public bodies alike. Traditional libraries are limited by storage space; digital libraries have the potential to store much more information, simply because digital information requires very little physical space to contain it. As such, the cost of maintaining a digital library is much lower than that of a traditional library.</h2><br />

                            15. Main idea
   john cabot was the first englisman to land in north America. However, this man who legitmized England's claim to everything from labrador to florida, left no sea journal, no diary or log, not even a portrait or a signature. Until 1956 most learned encyclopedias and histories indicated that Cabot'a first landfall in America was Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Then a letter was discovered in the Spanish archives, making it almost certain  that he had touched first at the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, within five miles of the site of leif  Ericson's ill-fated settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows. Researchers studying the voyages  of Columbus,  Cartier,Frobisher, and other early explorers had a wealth of firsthand material with which to work. Those who seek to recreate  the life and routes used by Cabot must make do with thirdhand accounts, the diloyal and untruthful boasts of his son, Sebastian, and a few hard dates in the maritime records  of Bristol, England
main idea of  the paragraph</h2><br />
                        The main paraghraph is John Cabot was the first englishman to land in North America. (anyways, lain kali difoto aja... emang kamu gak capek ngetik?)<br />

                            16. Fort Rotterdam Fort Rotterdam is located in the center of Makassar city. It was originally built in the 16th century by a sultan of Gowa-Tallo for a defense against the Dutch attack and was called Jum Pandan. However, the Sultanate later fell into Dutch occupation and the fort was renovated into a bigger and stronger fort. The renovation was done using karst, limestone, and timber from nearby area. It was renamed as Fort Rotterdam, after Dutch admiral Speelman's birthplace. It was then become the center of Dutch power in Sulawesi. Source: http://ksmtour.com/ Standing majestically at the western coast of Makassar, South Sulawesi, Fort Rotterdam is recognized as the city's most iconic landmark. Inside the fort, there are thirteen buildings. At the centre of the fort is a church building. Several buildings along the north and south curtain walls still exist. Visitors can also visit a museum, called the La Galigo Museum. It is a place to store various historical objects about humans in ancient times. The buildings on the south curtain house a museum displaying local skills in silk weaving, agriculture and boatbuilding, and scale models of indigenous boats. The barracks on the eastern wall now house a small library. There are also ships' logs of Voc captains and ancient lontar manuscripts. The department of archaeology is housed in the former building of the head of administration for the VOC. The southwestern Bastion contains a prison where Prince Diponegoro was imprisoned at the end of his life. Currently Fort Rotterdam is still standing strong and open to public. It is now not only as a tourist attraction and becomes the icon of the city of Makassar, but also as a place to carry out various events. Today, the buildings contain the national archives, the historical and archaeological institute, conservatory of dance and music, art development services and the state museum.
