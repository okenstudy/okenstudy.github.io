                                            Unplug all wires connected to the tower and if there is a power switch on the back, switch it off. Take out the screws on the back of the tower, take out the panel, then take out the motherboard tray. Take the motherboard and screw it on the motherboard tray then slide it back into the case. Firmly insert RAM sticks into the long and narrow slots usually located at the top right of the motherboard. Carefully place the CPU into the socket that is square shaped on the motherboard then place the CPU fan For video cards, look for a slot about the length of your middle finger and has very small lever, Take out the small case panel about the size of your finger on the back and firmly insert the card Into the slot, make sure the back of the card comes outside. For sound/ network cards look for a slot similar to the video card slot, but slightly shorter dos uo and without the lever. Slowly slide the hard drive into the hard drive bay usually located at the front of the tower then connect the cables from the back of the hard drive the motherboard. CD/DVD drives are similar to hard drives, just slide it into the bay at thetop (right or left depending on the panel that is open) and connect the wires. For audio devices, match the colours and USB is pretty much selfexplanatoryIf you have a video card the back of it should be sticking outside which is where you connect the monitor cable to, unless there is no video card then you connect the cable to the motherboard. Video cards nowadays come with adapters for older monitors so make sure to connect the adapter to the back of the video card before plugging in the monitor.

Strategy Overview
Most content that students learn has or fits into a “structure”—an organizational
pattern or framework that acts as a set of orderly slots for
specific pieces of information. When students have a solid understanding
of structure—when they know how fairy tales are designed
around a beginning, middle, and end, when they understand how the
three branches of government interrelate or how protons, neutrons,
and electrons make up atoms—they are not only showing “big picture”
comprehension; they are ready to learn more. Pattern Maker (a.k.a.
Extrapolation) is a strategy designed to help students “see” the patterns
and structures behind texts and ideas. Students arrive at this bigpicture
understanding through the process of extrapolation; that is,
students
· Closely examine known or easily understood sources.
· Extract the key structural elements from these sources.
· Put their newfound structural comprehension to work by using it to
better understand a new source, create a product of their own, or make
improvements to an everyday object.</a>

                                            Practice Test A - ReadingQuestion 1-10The conservatism of the early English colonists in North America, their strong attachment to the English way of doing things, would play a major part in the fumiturethat was made in New England. The very tools that the first New England fumiture makers used were, after all, not much different from those used for centuries - even (5) millennia: basic hammers, saws, chisels, planes, augers, compasses, and measures. These were the tools used more or less by all people who worked with wood: carpenters, barrel makers, and shipwrights. At most the furniture makers might have had planes with special edges or more delicate chisels, but there could not have been much specialization in the early years of the colonies.Line(10) The furniture makers in those early decades of the 1600's were known as "joiners,"for the primary method of constructing tumiture, at least among the English of this time, was that of mortise-and-tenon joinery. The mortise is the hole chiseled and cut into one piece of wood, while the tenon is the tongue or protruding element shaped from another piece of wood so that it fits into the mortise and another small hole is (15) then drilled (with the auger) through the mortised end and the tenon so that a whittled peg can secure the joint – thus the term "joiner." Panels were fitted into slots on the basic frames. This kind of construction was used for making everything from houses to chests.Relatively little hardware was used during this period. Some nails - forged by (20) hand - were used, but no screws or glue. Hinges were often made of leather, but metal hinges were also used. The cruder varieties were made by blacksmiths in the colonies, but the finer metal elements were imported. Locks and escutcheon plates - the latter to shield the wood from the metal key - would often be importedAbove all, what the early English colonists imported was their knowledge of 25) familiarity with, and dedication to the traditional types and designs of furniture they knew in England.1.

Most content that students learn has or fits into a “structure”—an organizational
pattern or framework that acts as a set of orderly slots for
specific pieces of information. When students have a solid understanding
of structure—when they know how fairy tales are designed
around a beginning, middle, and end, when they understand how the
three branches of government interrelate or how protons, neutrons,
and electrons make up atoms—they are not only showing “big picture”
comprehension; they are ready to learn more. Pattern Maker (a.k.a.
Extrapolation) is a strategy designed to help students “see” the patterns
and structures behind texts and ideas. Students arrive at this bigpicture
understanding through the process of extrapolation; that is,
students
· Closely examine known or easily understood sources.
· Extract the key structural elements from these sources.
· Put their newfound structural comprehension to work by using it to
better understand a new source, create a product of their own, or make
improvements to an everyday object.</h2><br />

Kebanyakan konten yang siswa belajar memiliki atau cocok menjadi "struktur" -sebuah organisasi
pola atau kerangka kerja yang bertindak sebagai satu set slot tertib untuk
potongan informasi tertentu. Ketika siswa memiliki pemahaman yang kuat
struktur-ketika mereka tahu bagaimana dongeng dirancang
sekitar awal, tengah, dan akhir, ketika mereka memahami bagaimana
tiga cabang pemerintahan saling berhubungan atau bagaimana proton, neutron,
dan elektron membentuk atom-mereka tidak hanya menampilkan "gambaran besar"
pemahaman; mereka siap untuk mempelajari lebih lanjut. Pola Maker (alias
Ekstrapolasi) adalah strategi yang dirancang untuk membantu siswa "melihat" pola
dan struktur di belakang teks dan ide-ide. Siswa tiba di bigpicture ini
memahami melalui proses ekstrapolasi; itu adalah,
siswa
· Erat memeriksa sumber yang diketahui atau mudah dipahami.
· Ekstrak elemen struktural utama dari sumber-sumber.
· Masukan pemahaman struktural baru mereka untuk bekerja dengan menggunakannya untuk
lebih memahami sumber baru, membuat produk mereka sendiri, atau membuat
perbaikan obyek sehari-hari.<br />

                            20. Practice Test A - ReadingQuestion 1-10The conservatism of the early English colonists in North America, their strong attachment to the English way of doing things, would play a major part in the fumiturethat was made in New England. The very tools that the first New England fumiture makers used were, after all, not much different from those used for centuries - even (5) millennia: basic hammers, saws, chisels, planes, augers, compasses, and measures. These were the tools used more or less by all people who worked with wood: carpenters, barrel makers, and shipwrights. At most the furniture makers might have had planes with special edges or more delicate chisels, but there could not have been much specialization in the early years of the colonies.Line(10) The furniture makers in those early decades of the 1600's were known as "joiners,"for the primary method of constructing tumiture, at least among the English of this time, was that of mortise-and-tenon joinery. The mortise is the hole chiseled and cut into one piece of wood, while the tenon is the tongue or protruding element shaped from another piece of wood so that it fits into the mortise and another small hole is (15) then drilled (with the auger) through the mortised end and the tenon so that a whittled peg can secure the joint – thus the term "joiner." Panels were fitted into slots on the basic frames. This kind of construction was used for making everything from houses to chests.Relatively little hardware was used during this period. Some nails - forged by (20) hand - were used, but no screws or glue. Hinges were often made of leather, but metal hinges were also used. The cruder varieties were made by blacksmiths in the colonies, but the finer metal elements were imported. Locks and escutcheon plates - the latter to shield the wood from the metal key - would often be importedAbove all, what the early English colonists imported was their knowledge of 25) familiarity with, and dedication to the traditional types and designs of furniture they knew in England.1.
